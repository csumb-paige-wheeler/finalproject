          <p>First of all, welcome to CSUMB! I hope you’re enjoying your time here so far. If you’ve come to this page
            for advice, I hope you find mine helpful!
          </p>
          <h4>Academics</h4>
          <p class="p-advice">The main thing to watch out for academics-wise is keeping up with your assignments,
            projects, and exams for your classes! It’s easy to feel a lack of motivation to keep up with schoolwork or
            even attendance, especially since many classes have ongoing assignments, but it is important not to let it
            build up too much so that you don’t get overwhelmed during midterms and finals. A planner really helps, as
            does using Google Calendar effectively to block out times to work on assignments.
          </p>
          <h4>Extracurriculars</h4>
          <p class="p-advice">Extracurriculars at CSUMB include clubs, athletics, and other organizations. I encourage
            joining an affinity group to find community, especially if you have moved from another area. I, personally,
            joined APIA, which has provided me with a sense of community and belonging since I am not from this area.
          </p>
          <p>I personally do not have much experience working with Recreation, who are in charge of athletics and other
            outdoor activities, but I encourage joining their events to gain community and get outdoors!
          </p>
          <h4>Working & School</h4>
          <p class="p-advice">From my time in Community College and working, I have definitely had my share of
            experience balancing both. While having a job may be necessary, it is also important to set aside time for
            yourself in order to not burn yourself out. Time blocking comes in handy especially while balancing school
            and a job, in order to dedicate time to self-care. If possible, I would also encourage trying to find an
            on-campus job such as a student assistant. On-campus jobs are typically more understanding of your class
            schedule and the time needed to study.

          <p class="p-advice"> Hi, I've been here for two years now and I've seen/done about everything there is here at
            CSUMB. Super Involved, I am.</p>
          <h4>Clubs</h4>
          <p class="p-advice"> Finding a stable group of friends or people to hang out with is a gamble at this school
            because; 1. You already have those friends since day one, or 2. You feel like you never will have those
            friends. The bestest way of getting around this hoop is investing free time into clubs and the members
            involved. This is the definitive way of finding other students with similar likings. You really just have to
            talk (I know, it's hard), but once you learn how, it's smooth sailing from there.!</p>
          <h4>Google Calendar</h4>
          <p class="p-advice"> Please, please, PLEASE do not wait until it's too late to use Google Calendar. If you are
            like me, living on campus, you will find yourself not knowing what to do because, often times, there isn't
            much to do. Start putting your life on a schedule, make things easy for yourself, and build good, healthy
            habits!</p>
          <h4>Express Yourself</h4>
          <p class="p-advice">More generally, but most importantly; Be yourself and express yourself for who you are.
            Once you show your community who you are, you'll find people that love you for it. All in all, be genuine to
            others and yourself. Be you.</p>

          <p>Hiya new student, prospecting high school senior or soon to be transfer! I am so glad you are here and
            CSUMB is too! We at CSUMB are so proud of you for taking this next leap into your education and we look
            forward to all you accomplish! With that being said, there are a few things that I would love to give you
            advice with while you're first starting on your journey.
          </p>
          <h4>Connections</h4>
          <p class="p-advice"> Making connections is crucial to success in college. Building relationships with classmates, professors, and others in your field allows you to expand your network, gain insights into your field of study, and discover new perspectives. It may even lead to mentorship opportunities, internships, and job offers after graduation. Attend networking events, join clubs, and strike up conversations with your peers to take advantage of these opportunities.
          </p>
          <h4>Tutoring</h4>
          <p class="p-advice"> Struggling with college coursework? Feeling overwhelmed and stressed? A tutor can make all the difference! Tutors provide personalized support, help you understand difficult concepts, and offer study strategies to boost your confidence. CSUMB offers free tutoring through CLC, but if that's not for you, online tutors are also available. Seeking a tutor is a smart move that shows you're taking control of your education. Reach out to your professor or campus tutoring center today!
          </p>
          <h4>Talk to your Professor</h4>
          <p class="p-advice"> In college, your professors can be your allies! Despite what you might think, they're not intimidating or scary - they're there to help you learn and succeed. If you're struggling with a particular topic or assignment, don't hesitate to ask for help. You can schedule office hours or send them an email - just be polite and explain your situation clearly. Your professor will appreciate your initiative and dedication to learning. So take a deep breath and give it a try!
